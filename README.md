# Dr. Damien Jeannerat

Damien Jeannerat is an expert in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, with a strong focus on methodological developments and computational processing techniques for high-resolution spectral analysis. His work spans various areas of NMR, particularly in small molecule characterization, signal processing, spectral aliasing, and data standardization.

Key Areas of Expertise:

### NMR Method Development & Computational Enhancements
- Spectral aliasing to enhance resolution in multidimensional NMR.
- Phase and reference frequency analysis in 1D and 2D NMR.
- Homonuclear and heteronuclear decoupling techniques for improved resolution.
- Graphical representation of signal-to-noise and artifacts (SAN Plot).
- Computer-optimized spectral processing for peak deconvolution.

### Application of NMR to Organic and Natural Products Chemistry
- Structure elucidation of complex organic molecules and natural products (e.g., alkaloids, oligosaccharides, and pharmaceuticals).
- Use of high-resolution HSQC and chemical shift aliasing for data enhancement.
- Application of NMR to drug formulations, such as glaucoma treatments and controlled-release pharmaceuticals.

### NMR Standardization & Data Integrity
- Development of NMReDATA, a standardized format for reporting NMR parameters.
- Advocacy for open-access raw NMR data to ensure reproducibility and transparency in research.

### Instrumentation & Experimental Techniques
- Development of new pulse sequences for ultrahigh-resolution NMR.
- Advanced 2D and multidimensional NMR methods for resolving overlapping signals.
- Use of slice-selective experiments for weak molecular interactions.

### Interdisciplinary Applications of NMR
- NMR-based discrimination of polymers and flame retardants in materials science.
- Study of diffusivity in hydrogels for pharmaceutical applications.
- Real-time monitoring of dynamic molecular systems using HSQC.

## Academic at University of Geneva from 2000 to 2019:

Authored numerous high-impact research articles in Magnetic Resonance in Chemistry, Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Angewandte Chemie, and other leading journals. Published book chapters on NMR signal processing, spectral aliasing, and multidimensional spectroscopy. Supervised doctoral research focused on high-resolution 2D NMR, aliasing techniques, and signal deconvolution.
